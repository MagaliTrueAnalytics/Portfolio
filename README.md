<h1>Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!</h1>

This repository showcases **real-world case studies** based on publicly available datasets, such as those on **Kaggle**, featuring comprehensive analyses, visualizations, and insights.

In addition to existing datasets, realistic datasets simulating real-world scenarios can also be **generated using GenAI**, tailored to specific characteristics provided for analysis.

As of now, three projects are available, with more exciting analyses on the way!

<h2>📂Project Structure</h2>

Each project is organized into a dedicated folder containing three subdirectories:

📊 **Data** – Includes the dataset, typically in CSV format, used for analysis.

📜 **Notebook** – Contains the Jupyter Notebook with Python code, structured as a **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** including methodology, data cleaning, visualizations, and insights.

📄 **Report** – Stores the final report in PDF format, generated using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva. Additionally, this folder includes either:

A PDF version of dashboards created in environments like **IBM Cognos or Power BI**, where interactive URLs are not available due to platform limitations without subscription.

A **Plotly/Dash dashboard** URL when an interactive version is accessible.
