- **GDP per capita**
- **Healthy life expectancy**
- **Family & social connections**
- **Freedom**
- **Trust in government**
- **Generosity**

These metrics offer insights into their role in shaping **happiness worldwide**.

## 🏗️ AI-Powered Insights
Enhanced by **Generative AI**, this project leverages AI-driven techniques at every stage—from data analysis to visualization and narrative—providing a **rich exploration of global trends in happiness and economics**.

## 🔍 Dataset Information
The **World Happiness Report** is a global survey that assesses the state of happiness worldwide, examining how **economic, social, and governance factors** influence both personal and national well-being. 

This dataset, available under the **CC0: Public Domain license** on Kaggle, provides happiness metrics across multiple countries. For this project, we focus on the **2016 dataset**, which has been **slightly modified** for guided analysis.
