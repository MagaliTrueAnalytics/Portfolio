<h1>🚀Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!✨</h1>

This repository showcases **real-world case studies** based on publicly available datasets, such as those on **Kaggle**, featuring comprehensive analyses, visualizations, and insights.

In addition to existing datasets, realistic datasets simulating real-world scenarios can also be **generated using GenAI**, tailored to specific characteristics provided for analysis.

As of now, five projects are available, with more exciting analyses on the way!

<h2>📂Project Structure</h2>

Each project is organized into a dedicated folder containing three subdirectories:

📊 **Data** – Includes the dataset, typically in CSV format, used for analysis.

📜 **Notebook** – Contains the Jupyter Notebook. For BI projects using Power BI, the notebook is available but does not contain Python code, as all data analysis is performed directly in Power BI. For other projects, it includes Python code and is structured as a **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** detailing methodology, data cleaning, visualizations, and insights.

📄 **Report** – Stores the final report in PDF format, generated using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva (except for Power BI projects). Additionally, this folder includes either:

A PDF version of dashboards created in environments like **IBM Cognos or Power BI**, where interactive URLs are not available due to platform limitations without subscription.

A **Plotly/Dash dashboard** URL when an interactive version is accessible.
