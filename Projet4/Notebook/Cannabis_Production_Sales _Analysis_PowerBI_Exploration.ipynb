The following steps were carried out to prepare the data for analysis and visualization:  \n\n#### **1️⃣ Data Extraction**  \n- The dataset was imported into Power BI via **Get Data → CSV** to establish the initial connection.  \n- Source data contained **sales and production figures** for a simulated cannabis company.  \n\n#### **2️⃣ Data Transformation (Power Query)**  \nBefore conducting analysis, key **data formatting and cleaning** steps were applied in **Power Query**:  \n✅ **Data Types Formatting** – Adjusted currency values and decimal precision for consistency.  \n✅ **Data Quality Checks** – Verified **missing values, duplicates, outliers**, and column statistics.  \n✅ **Month Column Creation** – Generated a **Month (text format)** column using **M language** for improved filtering in reports. \n✅ **Data Validation** – Ensured all transformations maintained integrity without introducing inconsistencies.  \n\n#### **3️⃣ Data Loading & Modeling**  \n\nAfter transforming the dataset in **Power Query**, the cleaned data was loaded into Power BI for **exploration and analysis**. Since this dataset follows a **flat structure (single table)**, **no relationships** needed to be set up in the data model.\n\nKey steps during the loading phase included:  \n\n✅ **Importing the processed table into Power BI** for visualization.  \n✅ **Creating DAX measures** to enhance business insights:  \n   - `Total Revenue` – Sum of all sales revenue.  \n   - `Total Margin ($)` – Gross profit generated from sales.  \n   - `Total Margin (%)` – Profit margin percentage for financial analysis.  \n   - `Weighted Customer Satisfaction` – Customer satisfaction weighted by sales volume, ensuring that high-selling products impact the overall satisfaction metric proportionally. \n\n✅ **Adding DAX calculated columns** for further analysis:  \n   - `Margin $` – Net profit per product.  \n   - `Margin %` – Profit percentage for comparative analysis.  \n\n✅ **Setting up slicers** (Date/Month & Product strain) to allow **interactive filtering** of insights.  \n\nSince the dataset does not require **complex relational modeling**, the focus was on **optimizing calculated measures** and ensuring that Power BI visualizations effectively capture business trends. 🚀  ",
