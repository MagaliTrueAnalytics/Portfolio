<h2>Cannabis Production & Sales Analysis – A Power BI Exploration</h2>

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project explores **sales and production data** for a simulated cannabis company, leveraging **Power BI** for interactive analysis and insights. The dataset was **generated using GenAI**, providing a **fictional yet structured business scenario** to model real-world performance metrics.  

Through **data-driven visualizations**, the report presents:  
✅ Revenue and profitability trends  
✅ Production efficiency and environmental impact analysis  
✅ Forecasting models and key business drivers

## 📊 **Project Breakdown**  

### **1️⃣ Dataset Generation**  
- The dataset was created via **GenAI**, simulating **one year of cannabis sales and production**.
- CSV file structured for **visualization, forecasting, and business insights**.

### **2️⃣ Power BI Report Development**  
The **Power BI Desktop** report includes **interactive dashboards** analyzing:  
✅ **Sales Performance** – Revenue trends, customer segmentation, forecast modeling  
✅ **Production Insights** – Yield optimization, cost analysis, environmental impact  
✅ **AI-Driven Influencers** – Identifying revenue, satisfaction, and yield drivers  

### **3️⃣ Jupyter Notebook (SOP)**  
The notebook details the **ETL process**, covering:  
🔹 **Data Extraction** – Connecting and transforming the dataset in Power BI  
🔹 **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, formatting, and ensuring data integrity  
🔹 **DAX Measures** – Implementing calculations for revenue, margin, and satisfaction  
🔹 **Visualization Setup** – Organizing interactive charts for key insights  

## 🚀 **Key Insights**  
- **Revenue increased by 6.3% in October 2024**, driven by **higher production yields (+4.92%)**.  
- **Hybrid strain** generated the **highest profit margin (50.76%)**, while **Indica had the highest sales volume**.  
- **Humidity levels directly impacted yield efficiency**, with **Indica thriving at 72–73% humidity**.  
- **Customer satisfaction influenced revenue**, with **a 4.98% increase boosting revenue by $2.29K**.  
- **AI-powered analysis** identified **sales volume, yield, and satisfaction** as top revenue drivers.
