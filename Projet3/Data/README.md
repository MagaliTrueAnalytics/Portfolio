<h2>Dataset Summary: Environmental Analysis Laboratory Certificates of Analysis (CofA)</h2>

<h3>📝Origin</h3>

This dataset was **generated to simulate** the operations of an environmental analysis laboratory specializing in **water quality testing**🚰, inspired by services like those offered by [H2Lab](https://h2lab.ca/) (e.g., drinking water analysis). The dataset represents **Certificates of Analysis (CofA)** for water samples, capturing key details about the **analysis process from sample reception to final certification**. It was created with the assistance of [Grok](https://grok.com/), an AI developed by **xAI**, which generated the dataset based on specified criteria to ensure realism and complexity for data analysis tasks.

Grok provided the [Python script](https://github.com/MagaliTrueAnalytics/Portfolio/edit/main/Projet3/Data/environmental_dataset.py) to generate the dataset, and the .py file was executed in **VS Code** to produce the .csv file. 

<h3>📊Content</h3>

The dataset contains 1000+ rows (including duplicates) and the following columns:
    ✅**Request_ID**: Unique identifier for each sample request (UUID string).
    ✅**Sample_Received_Date**: Date the sample was received, marking the start of the analysis process (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
    ✅**Number_of_Tests**: Number of tests requested per sample (1–10).
    ✅**Test_Type**: Category of tests, either "Chemistry" or "Microbiology".
    ✅**Test_Names**: Comma-separated list of specific tests (e.g., pH, Total Coliforms, Heavy Metals) for realism.
    ✅**Final_CofA_Date**: Date the CofA was printed, marking the completion of analysis (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY).
    ✅**Revenue**: Revenue generated from the CofA, calculated based on the number of tests (test price: $80–$300), in USD.
    
The data spans from January 1, 2023, to April 19, 2025, with **realistic test names** (e.g., Nitrate, E. coli) and logical date progression (Final_CofA_Date is 3–30 days after Sample_Received_Date).

<h3>🥷Challenges</h3>

To mimic real-world data imperfections, the dataset includes **intentional challenges**:
    ✅**Missing Values**: Approximately 5% of rows have NaN in Final_CofA_Date, Revenue, or Test_Names.
    ✅**Duplicates**: About 2% of rows are exact duplicates, simulating data entry errors.
    ✅**Inconsistent Formats**: Around 3% of dates use non-standard formats (e.g., DD-MM-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD).
    ✅**Outliers**: Approximately 2% of Revenue values are anomalies (e.g., $10 or $5000).
    ✅**Typographical Errors**: About 1% of Test_Type entries have misspellings (e.g., "Chemisty", "Microbio").
    
These imperfections make the dataset suitable for **practicing data cleaning, validation, and analysis techniques**.

<h3>🎯Objective</h3>

The dataset is designed for use in a data analysis or data science portfolio to **demonstrate skills in handling messy, real-world data**. Potential analyses include:
    ✅**Cleaning and standardizing** date formats and test types.
    ✅**Handling missing values** and **removing duplicates**.
    ✅**Identifying** and **addressing revenue outliers**.
    ✅**Analyzing trends**, such as average processing time (Final_CofA_Date – Sample_Received_Date) or revenue by test type.
    ✅**Visualizing test distribution** or **revenue patterns**.
    
The dataset serves as a **realistic yet challenging resource** for showcasing data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization capabilities.

<h3>🤝Acknowledgment</h3>

The dataset was generated by **Grok**, created by xAI, based on detailed specifications provided for the scenario. Grok's contribution included creating realistic test names, incorporating intentional data imperfections, and ensuring the dataset aligns with the operational context of an environmental analysis laboratory.
