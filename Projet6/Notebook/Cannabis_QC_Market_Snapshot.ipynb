      "source": "## 📊 Dataset Presentation\n\nThis analysis relies on a combination of **manually collected** and **webscraped datasets**, focusing on the SQDC cannabis offering in Québec as of **July 2025**.\n\n### 📝 1. SQDC Website (Manual Collection)\nBetween **July 13 and 17, 2025**, product-level data was manually collected from the official SQDC website. The focus was on four key product categories representing over 80% of the catalog:\n- *Dried flower*\n- *Ground cannabis*\n- *Pre-rolls*\n- *Hashish*\n\nCollected information includes:\n- Producer and brand names\n- Product pricing\n- Strain type (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid)\n- Dominance profile (THC/CBD/Balanced)\n- Category breakdown\n\nA separate Excel file also consolidates high-level stats such as:\n- Total number of products across all categories (including beverages, edibles, extracts)\n- Distribution by strain, dominance, and category\n\n### 🕸️ 2. Weedcrawler.ca (Web Scraped Data)\n\nOn **July 17–18, 2025**, authorized web scraping was performed on [quebec.weedcrawler.ca](https://quebec.weedcrawler.ca) using Python scripts executed in **Visual Studio Code**.\n\nExtracted data includes:\n- SQDC store names and their opening dates\n- Brands and products listed per store\n\nThree custom Python scripts used during this process are available in this repository:\n- `weedcrawler.py`: Extracts SQDC store names and their opening dates\n- `SQDC_StoreID.py`: Retrieves unique store IDs to streamline store-specific URL navigation\n- `Produits_succursales.py`: Collects detailed product information per store\n\nAll data was exported and saved as CSV files for seamless integration into the analysis workflow.\n\n### 🌍 3. Location Enhancement\nThe store dataset was enriched with **latitude and longitude** information:\n- Geo-coordinates for each city were generated using a GenAI tool\n- For cities with multiple stores (e.g. Montréal, Québec City, Laval), precise geo-coordinates were manually retrieved via Google Maps to avoid limitations in scraping and reduce API complexity\n\n### 🆔 4. Data Preprocessing\nBefore importing into Power BI:\n- Unique IDs were generated for producers and brands using randomized Excel formulas\n- Data cleaning and structuring were carried out in **Power Query**, including transformations, table relations, and schema refinement",

Key challenges emerged due to subtle text differences between manually collected and scraped datasets (e.g. apostrophes and special characters).\n\nSteps performed across all tables include:\n- Trimming and cleaning text fields\n- Converting text to uppercase\n- Replacing inconsistent values\n- Updating data types (e.g. price fields converted to fixed decimal numbers)\n\n#### 🧩 Table Preparation for Modeling\n\n- **Succursales_Produits**\n  - Split the `Marque-Nom` column using the `-` delimiter\n  - Created a new `Marque_Nom_Clean` column using M code\n\n- **Marques_Producteurs**\n  - Added `Marque_Nom_Clean` column for matching purposes\n\n- **Produits_Dominance**\n  - Created by duplicating `Produits_Prix` and retaining only relevant fields: `Categorie`, `Marque`, `Dominance`, and `Souche`\n\n- **Succursales_Produits** (continued)\n  - Left outer joined with `Marques_Producteurs` on `Marque_Nom_Clean` to add `Marque_ID` and `Producteur_ID`\n  - Left outer joined with `Produits_Dominance` using three keys (`Souche`, `Marque_ID`, `Souche`) to add `Dominance`\n\n#### 🔐 Anonymization Strategy\n\nTo protect brand and producer identities:\n- Added `Producteur_Alias` column in `Producteurs_SQDC` and `Marques_Producteurs` via M code\n- Added `Marque_Alias` column in `Marques_Producteurs`\n\n#### 🧮 Filtering for Active Producers\n\nTo focus the analysis on currently active producers:\n\n- Created the `Producteurs_ID_Actifs` table by duplicating `Succursales_Produits`, extracting `Producteur_ID`, and removing duplicates.  \n- This table was **not** loaded into the Power BI model but used as a filter via inner joins with:\n  - `Marques_Producteurs`\n  - `Producteurs_SQDC`\n  - `Produits_Prix`\n\nOnly producers referenced in the **Weedcrawler** dataset were retained for final analysis. \n\n🔗[Link for raw data and python script](https://github.com/MagaliTrueAnalytics/Portfolio/tree/main/Projet6/Data)",
