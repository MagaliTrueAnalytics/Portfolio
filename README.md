<h1>🚀Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!✨</h1>

This repository showcases **real-world case studies** rooted in publicly available datasets—such as those found on **Kaggle**—alongside original business explorations inspired by practical challenges. Each project combines structured analysis, thoughtful storytelling, and insightful visualizations to illuminate key patterns and decisions.

Beyond using existing datasets, I also **create realistic, industry-specific data simulations using GenAI**, tailored to defined characteristics and operational constraints.

My approach is driven by curiosity and purpose:  
I actively seek out **sectors that inspire me** and **business environments with operational depth**, such as **agriculture**, **cannabis production**, and other fields where data can unlock strategic clarity, efficiency, and innovation.

This portfolio is both a technical showcase and a reflection of how data can support **real-world problem solving** in industries that matter.

As of now, 7 projects are available, with more exciting analyses on the way!

<h2>📂Project Structure</h2>

Each project is organized into a dedicated folder containing three subdirectories:

📊 **Data** – Includes the dataset, typically in CSV or Excel format, used for analysis.

📜 **Notebook** – Contains the Jupyter Notebook. For BI projects using Power BI, the notebook is available but does not contain Python code, as all data analysis is performed directly in Power BI. For other projects, it includes Python code and is structured as a **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** detailing methodology, data cleaning, visualizations, and insights.

📄 **Report** – Stores the final report in PDF format, generated using tools such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva. Additionally, this folder may include:

- A **Power BI report file (.pbix)** that can be opened using [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494&msockid=037f41312a2265cf31a354cc2b6c642b) — a free tool that enables full interactivity (filters, tooltips, navigation) for all users.
- A PDF version of dashboards created in environments like **IBM Cognos** or **Power BI**.
- A **Plotly/Dash dashboard URL**, when an interactive online version is available.
