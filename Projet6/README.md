##  üåøCannabis Market Snapshot: Qu√©bec‚Äôs SQDC Landscape (July 2025)

This Power BI project explores the cannabis retail landscape in Qu√©bec as of **July 17, 2025**, with a focus on data available through the **Soci√©t√© Qu√©b√©coise Du Cannabis (SQDC)**.

### üîç Scope of the Analysis
The project offers a sectoral snapshot, combining manually collected and webscraped data to highlight key trends and market dynamics:
- **Product categories** analyzed: *dried flower*, *milled*, *pre-rolls*, and *hashish* (representing >80% of SQDC's catalog)
- **Price structures** across categories, strains, dominance (THC/CBD/Balanced), and producers
- **Provincial breakdown of producers** from Qu√©bec vs other Canadian provinces
- **Retail footprint**: opening dates and expansion trend of SQDC stores
- **Brand and producer relationships**, captured through multi-source data modeling

### üì¶ Data Sources
- **SQDC website** (manual collection): product catalog, pricing, dominance profiles, strains, categories, producers
- **Weedcrawler.ca** (authorized web scraping): detailed data on SQDC store network, product availability, brand distribution

### üìÅ Project Structure

As with other portfolio projects, the repository includes three main folders:  
- `/Data` ‚Äî contains the raw `.csv` and `.xlsx` datasets  
- `/Notebook` ‚Äî includes a structured Jupyter Notebook documenting each step from data collection to analysis and report creation, written as a SOP-style workflow  
- `/Report` ‚Äî hosts the Power BI `.pbix` file, a static `.pdf` version of the dashboard, and a Canva-formatted report for broader readability (french only)

üõà Notes on Producer/Brand Labeling  
All names are anonymized in the PDF and Canva reports for public neutrality.  
Tooltips in Power BI reveal original names only for internal reference and personalized insight.

### üñ•Ô∏è Viewing the Power BI Report
The interactive report file (.pbix) can be opened and explored using the free version of Power BI Desktop, available for download here: [Download Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads)

This format offers full interactivity, including dynamic filters, tooltips, and rich analytics. It makes the dashboard fully accessible to all producers‚Äîincluding small-scale actors and those who haven't yet embraced a fully data-driven culture.
