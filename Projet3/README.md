# AquaMetrics: Analysis Operational Performance & Revenue 🚰

## 📖 Project Overview
The **AquaMetrics dataset** simulates the operations of an environmental analysis laboratory specializing in **water quality testing**. Inspired by real lab services, this dataset represents **Certificates of Analysis (CofA)** issued for water samples, tracking the process from **sample reception to final certification**.

This dataset was generated using **Grok**, an AI by xAI, incorporating **realistic test names**, **structured imperfections**, and ensuring alignment with environmental lab operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to:
- **Assess operational performance** by cleaning and structuring imperfect data.
- **Identify revenue trends** and key financial insights.
- **Measure analysis efficiency** through sample processing times.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Sample Tracking:** Follows the journey from reception to certification.
- **Operational Insights:** Measures processing efficiency and revenue patterns.
- **Data Quality:** Addresses structured imperfections for a realistic representation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
The entire analysis and visualization were conducted using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook (Lite version on the cloud)**, with some limitations on available libraries. 

## 📂 Project Deliverables
This project presents findings through two key deliverables:
- **IBM Cognos Dashboard** (exported as a PDF due to platform limitations).
- **Comprehensive report** edited via Canva.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis workflow.
2. Review the Cognos dashboard for visual insights.
3. Consult the Canva report for an executive summary of findings.
