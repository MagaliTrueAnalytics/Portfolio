<h2>Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!</h2>

This repository showcases real-world case studies based on publicly available datasets, such as those on Kaggle, featuring comprehensive analyses, visualizations, and insights. As of now, two projects are available, with more exciting analyses on the way!

<h2>📂Project Structure</h2>

Each project is organized into a dedicated folder containing three subdirectories:

📊 **Data** – Includes the dataset, typically in CSV format, used for analysis.

📜 **Notebook** – Contains the Jupyter Notebook with Python code, structured as a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) including methodology, data cleaning, visualizations, and insights.

📄 **Report** – Stores the final report in PDF format, generated using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva. Additionally, this folder includes either:

A PDF version of dashboards created in environments like IBM Cognos or Power BI, where interactive URLs are not available due to platform limitations without subscription.

A Plotly/Dash dashboard URL when an interactive version is accessible.
